# FuelMonitoring
This repository is a part of the IOT based Fuel Monitoring System to detect fuel frauds and the keep track of the daily fuel usage. 
This is an Android Project which works alongside of the Arduino UNO which provides the values to the user.

This Application was developed by:

as a part of the Mega Project for the Year 2019-20.

Project Guide: Miss M. S. Patil

The Fuel Monitoring System is fully automotive system, that will detect possible fuel frauds at the fuel stations and also help the users keep a track of the daily fuel usage. The application will track the fuel usage by the user and analyse the data to produce effective outputs which will benefit the user. This application will give the user the ability to store his/her data onto the server which will enable the user to access the data from almost anywhere, at anytime. The application will take user feedback regarding the fuel stations and provide the other users with appropriate suggestions to find a good fuel station where frauds occur in less amount. The system interfaces with a Arduino UNO board mounted onto his/her vehicle which will process the data provided by the flow sensor. This will give the user information about the amount of fuel being filled into the vehicle at real-time accurately, hence notifying the user in case of fraud to avoid the financial loss of users. Along with this, the system will calculate the amount of fuel left in the fuel tank accurately and notify the user if the fuel level is low. Not just this, but also providing the user directions to the nearby fuel station with good ratings.

We hope this application benefits you users!
